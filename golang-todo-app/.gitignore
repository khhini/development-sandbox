# Package cache
# This is typically located in GOPATH/pkg/mod/cache, but if you have a local cache
# within your project, you might want to ignore it.
pkg/

# Go module cache (if not using standard GOPATH)
# This is usually managed by Go itself and not typically in the project root,
# but if it somehow ends up there, ignore it.
# go.mod.sum # This should generally be committed
